### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="5%"> 

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems](https://cemsiis.meduniwien.ac.at/en/). 
My research focuses on methods and software for clinical trials with multiple endpoints and adaptive platform trials.

- âš¡ I'm currently working on non-concurrent controls (see [NCC_timetrends](https://github.com/MartaBofillRoig/NCC_timetrends) and [NCC-pkg](https://github.com/pavlakrotka/NCC))
